Hello,
	Afzal Ali is here ,This project is made by me during my training .
This is the Bank Management System project which is totally written core in python.
This project file contains script (Application.py) and a "Bank" directory in which 
a "bank.db" text file also present as well as a log file which will be automatically 
create after the execution of script ,The log file contain the information of each
steps (i.e. transactions) which is use to rectify the errors.
	we use sheleve database in it which contain the persistant data of objects 
of python.
This is console based system which is very easy to understand and use.
Talking about the system,it contains all the basic functions which include
following features :---------
	1.Login(::A user can login::)
	2.Sign-up(::A new user can sign - up::)
	3.admin (::This is only for administration purpose::)
	4.Exit(:: For existing ::)
When a user login the following features will be provide to him/her:----
	1.Credit(::To credit the amount::)
	2.Debit(::To debit the amount::)
	3.Check balance(::for checking balance::)
	4.update password(::for updating the password::)

features of admin 

The admin features can only access by the administrator:---
	1.Reset password of an account
	2.check account details
